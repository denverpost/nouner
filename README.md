# Nouner
Given a lookup object and a chunk of text, link any matching proper nouns within the text

## Usage
Look at www/include.html for the js in use on production.

Look at www/example.html for a bare-bones implementation.

## Updating the lookups
The current workflow has plenty of room for improvement:

First, download the Google Sheet as a CSV. Then:
```
cd www
cp ~/Downloads/Sports\ Lookups\ -\ broncos.csv csv/broncos.csv
python csvtojs.py csv/broncos.csv > lookup/broncos.js
```

## Performance Considerations
In addition to the extra JS being downloaded on the page, every time the noun-matcher runs  it:

1. Loops through each paragraph.
2. Pulls out all the proper nouns in each paragraph.
3. Loops through those proper nouns and looks to see if any of those match the proper nouns we have in our list.
4. If there's a match, it replaces that proper noun with a piece of linked text.
